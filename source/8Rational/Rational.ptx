  <title>LO8: Rational Functions</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In LO 7, we learned about polynomial functions. More specifically, we learned how to find and describe the end behavior of polynomial functions, find <m>x</m>-intercepts and <m>y</m>-intercepts, and determine their behavior (bouncing off the <m>x</m>-axis or crossing through the <m>x</m>-axis). In LO 8, we will learn about what happens when we divide one polynomial function by another.
  </p>


  <p>
    An important question we should ask ourselves is this: Why are we focusing on division but ignoring addition, subtraction, and multiplication? Let's look at some examples, using <m>f(x)=x^2+3x</m> and <m>g(x)=x^2-1</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we add these two functions, we get...

    <md>
      <mrow> f(x)+g(x) \amp = (x^2+3x)+(x^2-1) </mrow>
      <mrow> </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =x^2+3x+x^2-1 </mrow>
      <mrow> </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp =2x^2+3x-1 </mrow>
    </md>

    This shows that the result of adding two polynomial functions is just another polynomial function, and we already know how to handle polynomial functions.

  </p>
    
    
    <p>
      The same thing happens when we subtract polynomial functions...

      <md>
        <mrow> f(x)-g(x) \amp =(x^2+3x)-(x^2-1) </mrow>
        <mrow> </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = x^2+3x-x^2+1 </mrow>
        <mrow> </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =3x+1 </mrow>
      </md>

    </p>
  
    <p>
      ... or multiply polynomial functions:
    </p>


    <p>

      <md>
        <mrow> f(x) \cdot g(x) \amp = (x^2+3x)(x^2-1) </mrow>
        <mrow> </mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = x^4+3x^3-x^2-3x </mrow>
      </md>
      
      When we add, subtract, or multiply two polynomial functions together, what we get as a result is just another polynomial function, so we don't need any new tools to handle these.
      
    </p>
    

    <p>
      But let's look at what happens when we divide <m>f(x)</m> by <m>g(x)</m>:

      <me>
        \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2-1}
      </me>

      We really haven't encountered a function that looks like this before, so we'll need to investigate this kind of function and figure out how to handle it.
      
    </p>
    

  <p>
    The name <em>rational functions</em> is based on the root word <em>ratio</em>, which means <em>fraction</em>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rational functions are a special type of fraction in which both the numerator and denominator of the fraction are <em>polynomials</em>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-rational-function">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A rational function is a function <m>f(x)</m> that can be written in the form 

        <me>
          f(x)=\frac{M(x)}{N(x)}
        </me>
        
        where <m>M(x)</m> and <m>N(x)</m> are both polynomial functions and <m>N(x) \neq 0</m>.
      </p>


    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
  In LO 8, we will learn how to determine the long-run and short-run behavior of rational functions, we will learn how to sketch graphs from rational function equations, and we will learn how to write rational function equations from graphs.
